In this series of blog entries I will describe my progress towards building a versatile yet compact option pricing system in C++. I will follow closely a book by Mark Joshi [C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Derivatives-Pricing-Mathematics-Finance/dp/0521721628). I will use this book as a guideline but I will include other sources as well.
