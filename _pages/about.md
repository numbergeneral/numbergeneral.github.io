**I am a quantitative analyst and developer based in Warsaw, Poland. Focused on creating practical Python and C++ applications for quantitative finance. By combining the strong mathematical and financial background with an ability to write clean and reliable code I am delivering robust and precise solutions for asset pricing and risk management problems.**

I have always been fascinated about combining computer science, finance and mathematics. I hold Master's degree and MBA in Finance and now I am working towards a degree in Mathematics.

At the fourth year of Finance Studies I have started my career in Risk as the Market Risk Analyst in PGE, one of the biggest Polish companies, which produces and trades power. Next, I have worked as a Market Risk Analyst for a Swiss power trading company Axpo Trading. After that I have joined EY as a Risk Consultant and finally I landed a job in Citi were I work currently as a Model Validator. 

During my career I have participated twice in the [Global Management Challenge](http://globalmanagementchallenge.pt/worldgmc/). Together with a team we first won the [National Vice-Championship](http://gmcpoland.pl/15-edycja-konkursu-gmc-poland-2014/), a year after [National Championship](https://gmcpoland.pl/en/15-edition-of-global-management-challenge-poland/) and represented Poland in World Championships in Macau, China.
